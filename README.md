Hi 👋, 
We are developers and data analysts @EnlightenedData.
We provide data consulting services that help you make informed decisions. 
👀 Our mission is to enlighten your data, hence the name. In case you have no data, we can help you collect them by designing and conducting surveys or havesting from Open Data sources.
We specialise in survey design, choice modelling, statistical modelling, spatial analysis, GIS technology, and data visualisation.
💞️ We are looking to collaborate on research and consulting projects, particularly those with research and data analysis components. 
We have rich experience working with industry and governments, domestically and internationally. Locally, EnlightenedData is a member of the modelling panel of TfNSW, NSW DPC, IPART, and Austroads. We have partnered with big consutling firms such as Deloitte Access Economics, CEPA, and Stantec.
